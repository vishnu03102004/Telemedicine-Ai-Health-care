# Telemedicine-Ai-Health-care

Telemedicine AI Disease Prediction System

This is a web-based telemedicine and AI-powered disease prediction system developed as a project. The system integrates Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare Management, and Telemedicine to provide patients with disease risk predictions, online consultations, and appointment scheduling. It follows a 3-tier architecture consisting of Frontend, Middleware, and Backend.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Bootstrap for UI, Charts for visualization)

Middleware: Flask/Django (Python-based Web Framework)

Backend: Python (AI Models – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks), SQLite/MySQL Database

Additional Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP (explainability), WebRTC (video calls)

Features
Authentication & Security

User Registration and Login (Admin, Doctor, Patient)

Password hashing (SHA-256) for secure authentication

Role-based access (separate dashboards for each user type)

Patient Module

Register, login, and update profile

Enter symptoms/health data for AI-based disease prediction (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, Hypertension, Mental Health, etc.)

View personalized reports & risk levels

Download PDF reports of predictions

Book appointments with doctors (online/offline mode)

Access telemedicine video consultation via WebRTC

Chatbot support for mental health and basic queries

Location-based doctor suggestions

Doctor Module

Login and manage profile

View assigned patients and their reports

Accept/reject patient appointments

Conduct video consultations with patients

Upload health advice or prescriptions

View analytics on patient history and prediction statistics

Admin Module

Manage Doctors and Patients (Add, Update, Delete)

Monitor system usage statistics

Generate reports of disease trends

Control role-based access to the system

Admin dashboard with charts and counts (appointments, patients, predictions)

This project demonstrates how AI + Web Technologies can be applied to create a real-time telemedicine platform. It not only predicts diseases using ML models but also provides doctor-patient interaction, appointment scheduling, and health data visualization—making it a comprehensive healthcare solution.
